2025-10-15 ‚Äî Refactor: Profile CRUD Cleanup + Reporting Split

Reduced POM comments to one-liners; no logic changes.

Added/standardized helpers:

UiTextHelper for HTML-decode + case-insensitive equality.

TestDataHelper for {DQ} and {EQ:n} decoding.

Hardened negative/XSS flows:

SubmitLanguageRaw / SubmitSkillRaw to avoid suppressing alerts.

AddLanguageAllowingInvalidLevel / AddSkillAllowingInvalidLevel to detect dropdown vs server validation.

Cleanup discipline:

ProfileDataCleanupHooks deletes scenario inserts using steps.Added; fallback wipe on failure.

Skills steps parity fix: added _invalidLevelExistedInDropdown field to match Languages steps.

Created branch refactor/profile-crud-cleanup from feature/profile-feature-files.

Earlier ‚Äî Profile Features (Languages & Skills)

Pages: Full CRUD for Languages and Skills, with explicit waits and toast checks.

Steps: Presence/absence/count assertions; step trackers for teardown; open Skills tab explicitly.

Features: ProfileLanguagesCRUD.feature, ProfileSkillsCRUD.feature aligned in structure.

Determinism: Wait-until-appears helpers for post-action stability.

Earlier ‚Äî Login Suite

LoginPage: OpenSignIn() flow; resilient locators for email/password; success probe via ‚ÄúSign Out‚Äù.

Steps: Positive login + negatives (invalid user, invalid pass, empty, whitespace, repeated failures).

Feature: Login.feature with @smoke, @negative, @desiredbehaviour tags.

Environment & Config

Base URL configured in settings.json / config.cs.

Driver and timeouts configured in DI hook; window maximize on sign-in open.

Tag strategy in features: @smoke, @negative, @currentbehaviour, @desiredbehaviour.

Backlog

GitHub Actions to publish Extent HTML as an artifact.

Secrets-based credentials; remove hard-coded examples from steps.

Retry attribute for known flaky UI areas.

Cross-browser matrix via runsettings.

Expand Profile Overview coverage beyond name edit.

üîë Migration Notes ‚Äì From Hooks.cs to ReportHook.cs

 1. Reporting code moved

Before: Hooks.cs contained ExtentReports setup (_extent, _htmlReporter, _test, _reportLock) and step logging inside AfterStep.

Now: All reporting logic is isolated in ReportHook.cs.
Hooks.cs is now only responsible for WebDriver setup/teardown and DI registrations.

 2. Report folder location

Before: Report path was built by walking up from bin/Debug/netX.Y/ to project root ‚Üí Reports/....

Now: Report is written directly to the bin folder (e.g. bin\\Debug\\net8.0\\TestReport.html).

var baseDir = AppContext.BaseDirectory; 
_reportDir = baseDir; // report folder in bin

 3. Screenshots location

Before: Saved in current working directory with filenames like Screenshot_{ticks}_{thread}.png.

Now: Always saved in a dedicated folder:
bin\\Debug\\net8.0\\Screenshots\\SCR_<step>_<timestamp>.png

var screens = Path.Combine(baseDir, "Screenshots");
Directory.CreateDirectory(screens);

 4. ExtentReport structure

Before: Steps were logged as plain text with _test.Log(Status.Pass/Fail, ...).

Now: Each Gherkin step creates a real Extent node (Given/When/Then/And), and buffered logs (Info(...) calls in step classes) are piped into that step node.

 5. Failures with screenshots

Before: On failure, screenshot path was absolute, and sometimes not embedded properly.

Now: Screenshots are saved into the Screenshots folder, and the image is attached directly to the failing step node via MediaEntityBuilder.

 6. System info

Before: Environment and Browser type were set in BeforeTestRun.

Now: Same info, but additionally tries to pull browserVersion and platformName from WebDriver capabilities in BeforeScenario.



üîë Key Changes to LoginPage

Locators expanded

Added SignInLink locator to support opening the sign-in modal/page.

Updated UsernameField locator to handle multiple possible attributes (type='email', placeholder='Email address', name='Email', or id='email').

Updated SuccessMessage locator to capture both Sign Out buttons (<button> or <a>).

Added explicit locators for inline error prompts:

PasswordErrorPrompt (password length validation).

EmailErrorPrompt (invalid email format).

ErrorToast (confirmation / general error popup).

New methods

OpenSignIn() ‚Äì clicks the Sign In link before login.

GetEmailInlineError(), GetPasswordInlineError(), GetPopupError() ‚Äì helper methods for fetching inline and popup errors.

IsAtLoginPage updated

Now waits for visibility of the username field instead of checking page title.

üîë Key Changes to LoginSteps

Navigation

Changed from NavigateTo("/login") ‚Üí NavigateTo("/") followed by _loginPage.OpenSignIn() to adapt to new flow.

Credentials

Updated valid credentials to "annie.jose1202@gmail.com" / "123456" (instead of the old tomsmith / SuperSecretPassword!).

Assertions for success

Changed success validation from checking "You logged into a secure area!" ‚Üí checking that "Sign Out" is visible.

Error handling

Extended error validation:

First check for inline prompts under email or password fields.

If no inline errors, fallback to toast/popup error elements (.ns-box, .ui.error.message, .alert-danger, etc.).

Assertions now cover a broader set of error patterns: "invalid" | "incorrect" | "unauthor" | "confirm" | "verification" | "failed" | "required".

üîë Key Changes to Config (TestSettings.json)

Base URL updated

From: http://the-internet.herokuapp.com

To: http://localhost:5003 (pointing tests to local environment).
